Compiling
--------------
We will try keep the building instructions as up-to-date as possible, but things may change without notice.

### Windows
You will require mysysgit or git installed with cygwin. Alternatively I would suggest installing GitHub for Windows and checking out the repo with that.

#### Check out the repo
Use Github for Windows or use a command prompt/powershell with git binaries in the Environment path.
```git clone https://github.com/OpenMods/OpenBlocks.git```
#### Change directory
```cd OpenBlocks```
#### Run ant build
```ant ```

The resulting file should be in the bin folder

### Linux or OSX
Much the same as Windows, open a terminal window where you wish to checkout the repo and type
```git clone https://github.com/OpenMods/OpenBlocks.git && cd OpenBlocks```
#### Then run ant
```ant ```

The mod jar will be in the bin folder after the completion of the build process.
